        <h2>Adjusting to a more eco-friendly lifestyle is easier than you think — small changes like recycling plastics, composting at home and shopping sustainably can add up.</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h4>1.BULK GOODS ARE THE ULTIMATE ECO FRIENDLY PRODUCTS</h4><br>
        <p>Consider buying staples in bulk and storing them in reusable containers like mason jars or cloth bags.<br>
            You can control the amount, you'll be able to get exactly what you need. And as an added bonus,<br> you should notice a difference in your bank account, since pre-packaged goods tend to come with a hefty price tag.To save even more, consider joining a food buying club (or start one).</p>

        <h4>2.NO PLASTIC BOTTLES</h4><br>
        <p>Approximately 40% of bottled water sold is actually tap water. Instead of being duped by clever marketing, invest in a quality water filter<br>
            and a sweet reusable water bottle. We love glass, but there are plenty of other sustainable options! And while you're at it, grab a thermos for your coffee or tea on the go. You'll be able to make it exactly the way you like it — and save a money, too.</p>

        <br> 
        <h4>3.INVEST IN A SET OF CLOTH PRODUCE BAGS</h4><br>
        <p>You know those flimsy plastic bags they offer in the produce department? Super wasteful. Investing in (and remembering to bring) a set of cloth produce bags will protect your purchases and prevent more plastic from ending up in the ocean and the bodies of aquatic wildlife. These bags are great for transporting bulk goods, too. Plus, your produce will never be cuter!</p>
        <h4>4.REUSE OLD CLOTHES</h4><br>
        <p>Make cloth rags out of old, un-donateable clothes and use them in place of paper towels for deep cleaning projects around the house.  If you go through a lot, check with your local thrift store — they may sell bulk rags created from un-salable donations. Or if a t-shirt just doesn't fit you anymore, turn it into a reusable bag! </p>
        <br>
        <h4>5.AVOID SINGLE-USE PLASTICS</h4><br>
        <p>Plastic cutlery, straws, plates, and cups clog our landfills and end up filling the bellies of sea turtles. So get yourself a set of reusable cutlery, stainless steel straws, and reusable containers to keep in your car or bag while you're out and about. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>6.AVOID PRODUCE WRAPPED IN PLASTICS</h4><br>
        <p>This is a tough one, because many supermarkets shrink-wrap every loose piece of produce they can get their hands on, even those that naturally have biodegradable packaging. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>7.GIVE VEGGIES A CHANCE</h4><br>
        <p>In a perfect zero-waste world, everyone would go vegan and consign environmentally destructive factory farming to history. But if you aren’t ready or able to give up meat, choose local, humanely raised meat. And consider making Meatless Monday a new tradition at your house. You might just be pleasantly surprised at how satisfying and delicious plant-based meals can be. </p>
